    "# re:Invent 2025 - AIM311: Optimize Open Weight Models for Low-Latency, Cost-Effective AI Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab 1a: Model Selection Framework\n",
    "**Focus**: Use-case-driven model selection, pricing analysis, performance optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn in Lab 1a\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab takes a **use-case-first approach** to model selection. Instead of starting with technical metrics, we'll help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify your use case** - Understand whether you're building a chatbot, agent, document analyzer, or multimodal application\n",
    "2. **Select the right model** - Learn which models match your specific requirements (latency, context window, capabilities)\n",
    "3. **Validate with benchmarks** - Review independent performance data to inform your decision\n",
    "4. **Analyze costs and performance** - Test real pricing and latency metrics with hands-on examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models We'll Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop covers 7 open-weight models available on AWS Bedrock:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Llama 4 Maverick** (400B MoE) - Multimodal chat and analysis with 1M context\n",
    "- **Llama 4 Scout** (109B MoE) - Ultra-long document processing with 3.5M context\n",
    "- **GPT OSS 120B** - Complex reasoning and agentic workflows\n",
    "- **GPT OSS 20B** - Fast, cost-effective responses for high-volume applications\n",
    "- **Qwen3 235B MoE** - Advanced reasoning with thinking mode\n",
    "- **Qwen3 32B** - Balanced performance for enterprise applications\n",
    "- **DeepSeek V3.1** (685B MoE) - Cost-optimized for high-volume deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus**: We'll also explore **Qwen3 Coder** models (480B MoE, 30B MoE) specialized for code generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Mixture of Experts (MoE)?**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) is an LLM architecture that uses multiple specialized \"expert\" networks within each layer, but only activates a subset of them for each input token. This sparse activation enables models to scale to several billion parameters while maintaining reasonable inference speed. However, MoE comes with higher memory requirements since all experts must be loaded.\n",

    "| Use Case | Priorities | Reference TTFT | Reference Throughput | Reference Latency | Why These Metrics Matter |\n",
    "|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| 💬 Chatbot | TTFT > Throughput > Latency | 500ms-1s | 50-100 tokens/s | 2-6s | - Users perceive <500ms TTFT as instant<br>- High throughput improves streaming responsiveness<br>- Cost matters at scale. |\n",
    "| 🤖 Agent | Quality > Tool Calling > Throughput | 1-3s | 25-50 tokens/s | 5-15s | - Accuracy more important than speed for multi-step workflows<br>- Acceptable to be slower since agents run in background<br>- Higher cost justified for better reasoning |\n",
    "| 📄 Document Analysis | Context > Quality > Cost | 2-10s | 25-50 tokens/s | 10-60s | - Context window must fit document size<br>- Latency less critical for batch processing<br>- Accuracy in extraction is paramount. |\n",
    "| 💻 Code Generation | Code Quality > Context > Speed | 1-4s | 25-50 tokens/s | 5-20s | - Correctness and syntax accuracy matter most<br>- Larger context helps understand full codebases<br>- Faster generation improves developer experience |\n",
    "| 🖼️ Multimodal | Multimodal Support > Quality > Speed | 1-5s | 50-100 tokens/s | 3-10s | - Images add 100-1000+ tokens depending on resolution<br>- Visual understanding accuracy is critical |\n",

    "### 📊 How to Use This Table\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find your use case** in the leftmost column\n",
    "2. **Check priority order** to understand what matters most\n",
    "3. **Compare your results** from the performance metrics above against the target thresholds\n",
    "4. **Review recommended models** for your use case\n",
    "5. **Read the rationale** to understand why these metrics matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Pro Tip**: The \"best\" model depends on your specific requirements. A model that's \"poor\" for chatbots might be \"excellent\" for document analysis. Always prioritize the metrics that matter most for YOUR use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights**:\n",
    "- **Chatbots**: Speed is king - users expect instant responses\n",
    "- **Agents**: Quality over speed - accuracy matters more than raw performance\n",
    "- **Document Analysis**: Context window is critical - must fit your document size\n",
    "- **Code Generation**: Specialized models worth the premium for accuracy\n",
    "- **Multimodal**: Limited options - Llama 4 Maverick is currently the only choice"
